# Database MySQL foundation course - Laboration 3

## JDBC basics agains MySQL database

This was our third major assignment for our MySQL database course. Before this we mainly used MySQL Workbench and pure queries against databases. 
This is our first assignment where we connected Java and MySQL together.
